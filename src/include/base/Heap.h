/**
 * The heap implementation of M3. Optimized for a small code size and small memory overhead for
 * management, rather than performance.
 *
 * Note that all methods do NOT return nullptr in case there is not enough memory. The reasoning behind
 * that is, that since the heap has a fixed amount of memory and there is no multithreading, there
 * are no reasons why a failure should be handled. One could think of:
 * 1) trying to allocate memory and try again later if it failed.
 *    This does not make sense here since the available memory will never change.
 * 2) trying to allocate memory and try again with less if it failed.
 *    This is not required since one can use contiguous_mem() beforehand to find out if it would
 *    fail or how much one might allocate at most.
 * 3) report an error at the point of allocation for better error messages.
 *    This might be a valid usecase, but backtraces achieve basically the same (without overhead).
 *
 * Thus, for simplicity, the heap will terminate the program if allocation fails since this is
 * always considered as an unrecoverable error. This removes the need to check for the return value
 * at many places (which improves performance and decreases the code size).
 *
 * It is also possible to use the C interface (malloc, ...), but this class should be preferred.
