 * In order to store the received messages, it has an associated RecvBuf. To receive messages over
 * this gate, you can subscribe this RecvGate to get notified as soon as a message arrived.
 *
 * Note also that you can bind a session object to a RecvGate. This allows you to associate data
 * with a gate. So, if you just want to receive messages, it suffices to create a RecvBuf, create
 * a RecvGate using that RecvBuf and give every sender a SendGate using the created RecvGate.
 * If you want to distinguish between the senders, you want to create a new RecvGate for every
